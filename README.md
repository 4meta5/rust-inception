# Rust Writes Rust

This program writes itself into a subdirectory and then does `cargo run` in that subdirectory. You can guess what happens next.

> *If you ever do `cargo run` this program, `CTRL-C` to stop the infinite code generation. You can delete all generated code by removing the root-level `test/` directory.*
